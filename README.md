# DrawBoard: A simple black-board where you can draw anything with your mouse (OpenCV project)
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------
## Project Goal

The goal is to utilize the OpenCV HighGUI module to create an application similar to "Paint". A window will be created where you can draw anything. You can choose which color to draw with (using a RGB color mixer window) and you can also define the paint brush size (i.e, width, using a trackbar). 

-----------------------------------------------

## Current Status, Usage, and Project Description

### Caution !!!

This is a simple application built using OpenCV. The OpenCV library is not meant for developing such GUI applications and can use up significant resources. There are other libraries which are built specifically for developing such applications. If you need something fancy look elsewhere. If you need something very simple and just want to have fun you can use this one.
